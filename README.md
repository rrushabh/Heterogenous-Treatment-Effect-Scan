GNN to extract HTE-ready data from EHR, healthcare data
Apply HTE scan for different treatments
Identify subgroups for which treatment is effective/ineffective
Identify disparity in who gets different treatments
For a given patient, estimate how they will respond to different treatments
LIMITATION: HTE scan only works on single binary treatments (administer medicine X or not), not sequences of treatments (administer 250ml of X, do this lab test, etc)
